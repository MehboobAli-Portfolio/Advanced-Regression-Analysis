# Advanced Regression Analysis 📈

A professional suite of regression models designed to predict continuous numerical values. This repository demonstrates the transition from basic linear estimation to complex, multi-variable, and non-linear predictive modeling using the Python scientific stack.

## 🚀 Overview
As a Software Engineer, I developed this hub to showcase the ability to engineer features and optimize models for datasets where simple linear relationships do not apply. These projects focus on accuracy metrics, feature selection, and the handling of multi-dimensional data.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each project is organized with its specific Jupyter Notebook and the associated dataset (.csv).

* **01_Multiple_Linear_Regression:** Predicting outcomes based on multiple input variables.
* **02_Polynomial_Regression:** Modeling non-linear relationships in data.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep-Dive

### 1. Multiple Linear Regression - Feature Impact Analysis 📊
* **Objective:** Predict CO2 emissions or fuel consumption by analyzing multiple independent variables (Engine Size, Cylinders, Fuel Consumption).
* **Engineering Focus:** Implementing multi-variable coefficient analysis and intercept calculation.
* **Evaluation:** Validated using **Variance Score** and **Residual Sum of Squares (MSE)** to ensure the model accounts for the maximum degree of data variance.

### 2. Polynomial Regression - Non-Linear Modeling 🧬
* **Objective:** Model complex, non-linear patterns where a straight line fails to capture the data trend.
* **Technical Focus:** Utilizing `PolynomialFeatures` to transform variables into higher-degree terms before applying linear models.
* **Achievement:** Improved model fit ($R^2$ Score) by capturing the curvature of real-world data distributions.
